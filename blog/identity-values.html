      1. Ethical Decision Example I once faced a situation where a teammate took
      credit for work I did. I had to decide whether to speak up or let it go to
      avoid conflict. I chose to talk to them privately, and they recognized my
      contribution. Looking back, I’m glad I handled it calmly without causing a
      scene. 2. Influence of Culture on Values and Identity My culture taught me
      to respect others, work hard, and value family. These lessons shaped how I
      treat people and approach challenges. My family and community helped me
      build these values, and they guide my decisions today. 3. Strengths
      Supporting Learning Journey I’m curious and enjoy learning new things. I’m
      also good at solving problems and finding creative solutions. These
      strengths help me stay engaged and keep moving forward when things get
      hard. 4. Limitations Affecting Learning and Career Development I sometimes
      struggle with time management and can feel unsure of myself. These can
      slow me down, but I’m working on improving how I manage my time and
      building confidence by focusing on small wins. 5. Working Productively
      with Resistance During a group project, a teammate didn’t like a new idea
      we suggested. I listened to their concerns and tried to find a compromise,
      which helped a little. In the future, I would start with more open
      communication to make sure everyone is on the same page from the
      beginning.
