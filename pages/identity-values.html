          <strong>1. Ethical Decision Example:</strong> I once faced a situation
          where a teammate took credit for work I did. I had to decide whether
          to speak up or let it go to avoid conflict. I chose to talk to them
          privately, and they recognized my contribution. Looking back, I’m glad
          I handled it calmly without causing a scene.

          <strong>2. Influence of Culture on Values and Identity:</strong> My
          mother always had a big emphasis on treating others how you would like
          to be treated and not to judge a book by its cover. These lessons
          shaped how I treat people and approach people today.

          <strong>3. Strengths Supporting Learning Journey:</strong> I’m curious
          and enjoy learning new things even though i am quiter slow to
          initially get it. I am a good listener and I’m also good at finding
          creative solutions as a group while trying to inclue all parties.

          I sometimes struggle with time management and can feel unsure of
          myself. These can slow me down, but I’m working on improving how I
          manage my time and building confidence by focusing on small wins.

          <strong>5. Working Productively with Resistance:</strong> During a
          group project, a teammate wasnt as excited about a new idea the team
          had suggested. I listened to their concerns and tried to find a
          compromise, and implement both idea's if possible, In the future, I
          would start with more open communication to make sure everyone is on
          the same page from the beginning.
