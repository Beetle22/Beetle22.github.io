          Believing in myself more, attempting to hold myself accountabile, when
          overwhelmed brake down problems so i can more easily compartmentalize
          them and not being spiral.

          This is a hard one for me i was asking about this in a previous humans
          resorces lecture, how does one hold themself accountable for things
          that only you are involved in. There comes a big level of self respect
          that needs to come along with it otherwise what are you holding
          yourself accountable to.

          Try to take a step back and ask for help, don't kick yourself when
          you're down. Remind myself that everyone learns at different speeds
          and that my learning process is something i am trying to improve.

          <h2>Wellbeing Plan</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The wellbeing framework we looked at was Te Whare Tapa Wha, in this
          example the five main points it looks at are: Whenua, Land and roots.
          Taha whanau, Family and Social.Taha hinengaro, Mental and Emotional.
          Taha wairua, Spiritual. Taha tinana, Physical wellbeing. Even looking
          at just 5 of these main points i kinda get overwhelmed by it all but
          if i were to simplify them down to the main things that resenate with
          me they would be along these lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          When i think about my Whenua, Waiheke island and the Hauraki Gulf is
          what comes to mind cause i grew up there. The way we respect the land
          is a big thing and i think says alot about a person, my dad has always
          been a big enviromentalist and a do rather than say kinda person. I
          would love to go back to the island and do some native planting in the
          raupo wetlands to try and preserve some of these sites. I have a solid
          group of friends that grew up with my on the island that live in
          wellington and connectting with them definitly helps me remeber my
          whenua.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some things i can think of that will help support my Taha whenua would
          be to try and catch up with closer friends when I am stuggling and
          feel like i dont just have to figgure it out in my head alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          To help maintain my Taha wairua i would like to try and go for more
          nature walks, try and keep in better contact with my mum. Try and be
          more genuinly open with people.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to doing things to help my Taha hinengaro, That is
          something ive been trying to figgure out for most my adult life. I
          think connecting with my close friends and family when i need support
          is somthing that really helps me but its hard because i also dont want
          to be seen as struggling because it makes people upset to see the
          people they love upset for such long periods of time so a lot of the
          time its just easier to put the mask on and show face.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to Taha tinana im not great at doing a lot of exercise
          othside of walking places through out wellington, one thing i would
          like to try improve on is my eating habbits, just getting into a
          consistiant dinner schedule would be good for me i think. as well as a
          more consistant sleeping pattern.
